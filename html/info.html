                          Macronutrients (macros for short) are what makes up the calorie content of food. 
                          The three categories of macros are fats, carbohydrates, and protein. It is important to count your macros and not just your calories because where you are getting your calories from really does matter.
                          Each macro provides a certain number of calories per gram.

                          <p class="lead mx-auto">
                            Getting the correct amount of protein, carbs and fat into your macro diet will help you reach your fitness goals, whether you want to lose weight or put on some muscle. Meal plans should have a balance of all the three key macronutrients: protein, carbs, and fats.
                          </p>
                          <p class="lead mx-auto">    
                            When your diet is too low in protein, you could lose muscle instead of fat, which can lead to a slower metabolism.
                            If you aren't getting enough carbs, you may be very low in energy. If you are low in fats, you might suffer from hormonal imbalances. If carbs or fats are too high, you may not see fat loss results.

                      <p class="lead">
                        Your main source of energy is from carbohydrates. Energy is essential to physical activity and our mental health, which shows why carbs are so important.  <span class="font-weight-bold">There are two types of carbs:</span> <span class="font-italic">Simple</span>
                        and <span class="font-italic">Complex</span>. Simple carbs such as table sugar, brown sugar, candy, soda, honey and fruit are easily digested, so they will provide us with quick energy. Complex carbs are more nutritious than simple carbs, are higher in fiber,                               and take longer to digest to keep you fuller longer. This provides more sustained energy in comparison to the quick energy of simple carbs. You can find complex carbohydrates in whole grains and vegetables.

                      <p class="lead">
                        Protein is the most essential macronutrient for those trying to reach their fitness goals. Helps you build muscle and and helps prevent muscle loss.
                        It is also the most satiating macro, helping you fend off hunger for longer periods of time and feel fuller. <span class="font-italic">Key foods rich in protein are meat, whey and eggs.</span>

                        Fats help us keep our hormone levels in balance and they are essential nutrients that our bodies need to live. It is important to get your fats from healthy sources and stay away from trans-fats,

                        Calculating macros means to figure out how much of each macronutrient you should be eating everyday and how many calories you need each day. 
                        Once you know your calorie intake per day, the next step is setting a percentage for each macro. 
                        A general starting point for a macro percentage breakdown might look like:

                          <li>25% Fat</li>

                          For example, if your daily goal consisted of a 1800 calorie limit, this is how your macro breakdown would look:

                          <li>Carbs: 40% X 1800 calories = 720 calories from carbs</li>
                          <li>Protein: 35% X 1800 calories = 630 calories from protein</li>
                          <li>Fat: 25% X 1800 calories = 450 calories from fats</li>
